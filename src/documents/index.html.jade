    h1 Hi, I'm Devon.
    p I am a student, programmer, &amp; writer.

    //- GENERAL

    p Hello! My name is Devon. I am a junior studying Computer Science at Stanford University. In my free time, I discuss the role of government with friends, consider the  peruse Reddit &amp; imgur, hike with my dogs, &amp; train for triathlons.

    p I'm interested in programming, artificial intelligence, economics, and design, and I am always seeking out opportunities to apply the skills I have learned in school to real world challenges.

    p I am a section leader for Stanford's introductory programming classes, CS 106A and 106B, in which I teach Java and C++ to students with little to no prior coding experience. As someone who came into college with no prior exposure to programming, it's particular rewarding to see my students progress because I remember being in their position only a few years ago and know firsthand how much a little push from supportive friends can propel someone forward into the world of computer science. Teaching has also given me an even better understanding of the fundamentals of CS and an ability to communicate with people about technical problems.

    p I'm also formerly the Editor in Chief of <i>The Stanford Review</i>, a bi-weekly contrarian paper that publishes investigative news and opinions articles. Some of my favorite subjects to think &amp; write about are healthcare reform, the interplay between privacy &amp; technology, tax policy, rationality, artificial intelligence, and the Second Amendment.

    h3 Octagon

    p In summer 2014, I designed and built an app called Octagon, a tool for venture capital firms. Octagon helps VCs better manage relationships with portfolio companies by visualizing important metrics about company growth and providing a repository for financial documents and quarterly updates. It also facilitates interaction between investors and board members and the startups in their portfolios in an analogous manner to CRM software. Octagon is currently in beta testing at Formation|8.

    p I was responsible for the full-stack of the app, though I was lucky enough for the last few weeks of the project to work with a friend named Zack who helped me immensely with the front-end, especially user interaction and fully utilizing the capabilities of our graphing libraries. You can find the open source code for the project on Github at <a href='github.com/devonzuegel/octagon'>github.com/devonzuegel/octagon</a>.
