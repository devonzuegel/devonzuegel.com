    h1 Hi, I'm Devon.
    p I am a student, programmer, &amp; writer.

    //- GENERAL

    p Hello! My name is Devon. I am a junior studying Computer Science at <a href='stanford.edu'>Stanford University</a>. In my free time, I discuss the role of government with friends, consider the  peruse Reddit &amp; imgur, hike with my dogs, &amp; train for triathlons.

    p I'm interested in programming, artificial intelligence, economics, and design, and I am always seeking out opportunities to apply the skills I have learned in school to real world challenges.

    p I am a section leader for Stanford's introductory programming classes, CS 106A and 106B, in which I teach Java and C++ to students with little to no prior coding experience. As someone who came into college with no prior exposure to programming, it's particular rewarding to see my students progress because I remember being in their position only a few years ago and know firsthand how much a little push from supportive friends can propel someone forward into the world of computer science. Teaching has also given me an even better understanding of the fundamentals of CS and an ability to communicate with people about technical problems.

    p I'm also formerly the Editor in Chief of <a href='http://stanfordreview.org/'><i>The Stanford Review</i></a>, a bi-weekly contrarian paper that publishes investigative news and opinions articles. Some of my favorite subjects to think &amp; write about are healthcare reform, the interplay between privacy &amp; technology, tax policy, rationality, artificial intelligence, and the Second Amendment.
