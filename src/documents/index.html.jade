 p Hello! My name is Devon. I am a senior studying Computer Science with a concentration in artificial intelligence at <a href='http://www.stanford.edu'>Stanford University</a>. In my free time, I read weird blogs, complete miscellaneous internet tutorials, hike with my dogs, &amp; train for triathlons. I love reasoning about, improving, and designing systems and infrastructure.
