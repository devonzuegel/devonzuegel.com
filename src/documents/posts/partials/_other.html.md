## Other things that I like ##

- An **aptronym** is a name aptly suited to its owner. A few of my favorite [notable examples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptronym#Notable_examples):
  - Sara Blizzard, meteorologist
  - John Carbon, American organic chemist
  - Bernie Madoff, who *made off* with a lot of other people's money
  - Marina Stepanova, former Soviet hurdler, first woman to run under 53 seconds in the 400 m hurdles
- Triathlons, especially coastal ones
- [Workflow optimization](./posts/workflow-optimizations-customizations)-- I probably spend more time optimizing my workflow than I actually save.
