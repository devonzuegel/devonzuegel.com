## My User Preferences files ##

Sublime User Preferences files are where you define your color scheme, theme, and a variety of other customizations like line padding, minimap toggling, and line highlighting. You can find your `/User/Preferences.sublime-settings` file by pressing `cmd + /` or by going up to the **Sublime Text > Preferences > Settings – User** menu. Here is my User Preferences file:

Sublime allows allows you to define language-specific user preferences. This particularly comes in handy for Markdown and plain-text editing, since they are so different from programming-centric uses of Sublime. For instance, I prefer not to have lines wrap around while I'm programming, but I can't live without it while working with real paragraphs rather than concise lines of code that are < 80 characters long. Also, I prefer my code-left-aligned, while I like having broad margins on either side of my text while writing.

To access and edit language-specific preference files, go to **Sublime Text > Preferences > Package Settings > Markdown Editing > MultiMarkdown Settings –– User** (replacing "Markdown Editing" and "Multimarkdown Settings –– User" with the language with which you're working).
