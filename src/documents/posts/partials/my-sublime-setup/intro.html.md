I love sharing little tips and tricks I've incorporated into my workflow, so I'm excited to write up this post surveying the key customizations I've made. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I've enjoyed writing it.

Better yet, I love learning new ways to better use Sublime! If there's anything here that I've missed, please don't hesitate to [email](mailto:devonz@cs.stanford.edu) or [tweet](http://twitter.com/devonzuegel) at me with your additions.
