I no longer identify as "libertarian". I still believe that drug use and consensual prostitution ought to be legal, that expanded gun ownership for self defense would make our country safer, and that many forms of regulation stifle innovation.

However, opportunities to have those views challenged or expanded are immediately squashed as soon as I use the phrase "As a libertarian..." to preface my thoughts. Once you define yourself with a particular label, your counterpart assumes he knows everything you're going to say, and his ears shut down.

The stock arguments for libertarians, Christian fundamentalists, climate change activists, and Republican party members are all well known, and we stop listening as soon as we know which vague group someone falls into. It's easier to neatly categorize their worldview into those stock arguments and write it off rather than take each part at face value and consider the sum of the parts in place of a simplistic monolith. Discussions of this sort rapidly devolve into a numbers game, where the metric of success is who has more arguments and credibility rather than whether or not you actually learn anything.

Political signaling raises another, more concerning issue that's even more destructive than limiting others' perception of your worldview. I find that self-identifying with a particular collective label limits my intellectual development directly, separate from the benefits of discussion with others.

I understand the urge to identify with understood labels. It's a way to signal that you're part of an in-group. In particular, for controversial ideologies like libertarianism, objectivism, or extreme forms of utilitarianism, it's a way to signal that you're interesting, well-read, and unconventional. These labels are a key tool in building and projecting a personal brand, but they come at the cost of actually learning anything.

The conversation is done as soon as you know what the other person labels himself as, stock argument, stifles debate... also boxing yourself in, you have to defend "your ", you're not going to kill your soldiers

If someone hands you a filter, in moments of ambiguity, can shape the reality that you create, we are always looking for filters so even easier if someone hands you

Sometimes they will include a unique historical example, study, or description to support their claim, but rarely do they 

the person they are trying to convince has little reason to believe that their respective argument will add significant value to the conversation.
