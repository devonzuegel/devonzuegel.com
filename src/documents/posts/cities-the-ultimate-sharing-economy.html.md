All of the furniture I brought into my first dorm room was free. A bamboo bookshelf, a papasan chair, and even a stationary bike trainer all came from the same place— an online community called Freecycle that connects people to give away things they no longer need. When my parents remodeled their living room they posted a big green sofa on the thread, and within minutes a newly married couple emailed them back saying it would be perfect for their new home. Without Freecycle, that couch would have been sent to the dump.

The qualities that make cities so green — density, mixed use zoning, and public transit — are amplified and extended by new internet sharing communities like Freecycle. When David Owen noted in [*Green Manhattan*](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/10/18/green-manhattan) that "heat escaping [his] apartment helped heat the apartment above", he was really commenting on the economies of scale enabled by the physical proximity of NYC living.

Now, online proximity is creating new kinds of economies of scale. Carpooling is made easy with Uber and Lyft; Airbnb enables homeowners to fill their empty guest rooms; and on special occasions girls can rent luxury dresses from Rent The Runway that would otherwise sit in their closet for most of the year.

As this sharing economy continues to grow, society's appetite for new things will decrease dramatically even as individuals' consumption rises. When we no longer have use for furniture, we can post it on Freecycle rather than throwing it in the dump. Car ownership amongst Millennials is dropping, with young people opting for Uber, public transit, or walking rather than buying personal and expensive cars that are parked upwards of 95% of the time. Airbnb has hosted over 25 million guests in already existing homes in place of traditional hotels. This shift from emphasizing ownership to expanding access is a huge step forward in ensuring modern life becomes more sustainable while maintaining a high standard of living.

For one, more sharing means fewer new things need to be made, decreasing the high environmental costs of manufacturing. Even better, fewer empty cars means fewer parking spots. The construction and maintenance of these massive swathes of asphalt require massive amounts of energy, and they readily absorb solar heat that raises the surrounding ground temperature by several degrees. More importantly, parking lots are a key culprit in creating low-density urban sprawl and they are a self-fulfilling prophecy; as more parking lots are built to accommodate traffic, the distances between destinations increases, further increasing the need to drive rather than go by foot.

The sharing economy enables us to increase the amount of time cars, guest rooms, and prom dresses are in use rather than taking up space in our driveways, homes, and closets. It's a win-win all around. Society is more sustainable and people are literally closer now that we've taken the phrase "one man garbage is another man's treasure" to heart.
