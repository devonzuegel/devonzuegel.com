Walkability should be a top priority in urban design, because it brings health and economic benefits that far outweigh its price tag. Urban planners spent the 20th century building cities for cars, not people, and alternative modes of transportation have been systemically undervalued across the US. Luckily, small changes can have an outsized impact in expanding alternatives to how people move around. 

## Infrastructure governs our habits

The American health care crisis is at its heart an urban design crisis. For every extra 5 minutes Atlanta residents drive each day, they are [3% more likely](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247496/) to be obese. [Car fatalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year) have killed far more Americans than [all of our wars combined](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/many-americans-died-u-s-wars/), and commuting by car [ranks as people's least favorite regular activity](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kirsten-dirksen/happiness-research-ranks-_b_829591.html). A 23 minute driving commute has the [same effect on happiness as a 19% reduction in income](https://books.google.com/books?id=VEUlBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT68&lpg=PT68&dq=driving+commute+has+the+same+effect+on+happiness+as+a+reduction+in+incomes&source=bl&ots=chNIIe4YMU&sig=5qd8i1ztJrki9WcrOIl2Wj9UfTc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiW1YekgLjOAhUH42MKHTb6AnAQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=driving%20commute%20has%20the%20same%20effect%20on%20happiness%20as%20a%20reduction%20in%20incomes&f=false).

"Doctors focus on remote disease risks, but what really kills us is our built environment,” [explained](http://www.metropolismag.com/October-2006/Our-Ailing-Communities/) Dr. Richard Jackson, a physician turned environmental health researcher. People who walk, bike, or take some form of mass transit to work [weigh less](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-commute-weight-study-idUSKBN0GJ29V20140819),[ live longer](http://www.apta.com/mediacenter/pressreleases/2010/Pages/100811_Public%20Health%20Benefits.aspx), and [have lower divorce rates](http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/why-a-long-commute-could-ruin-your-marriage.html) than commuters who drive. They also have [lower rates of depression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/urban-survival/201501/commuting-the-stress-doesnt-pay), [more free time](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2557564/Its-official-Commuting-work-makes-miserable-spending-half-hour-bus-worst-way-travel.html), and a [more robust social life](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_paumgarten).

Despite its costs, driving remains the most common mode of commuting in the US, at around [85 percent of all trips](https://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/files/2014/acs-32.pdf). One out of every six workers [commutes more than 45 minutes each way](https://books.google.com/books?id=0726UXcSEEsC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=Roughly+one+out+of+every+six+American+workers+commutes+more+than+forty-five+minutes,+each+way&source=bl&ots=6GkbbrpgZ9&sig=lT2Vy_433DG8K7i7OHlBrnO5aKc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLvu-Rg7jOAhUH8mMKHcgEBdsQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=Roughly%20one%20out%20of%20every%20six%20American%20workers%20commutes%20more%20than%20forty-five%20minutes%2C%20each%20way&f=false). But it's not drivers' fault; rather, our received infrastructure encourages – and in many cases forces – us to depend on cars. When our communities are built at the scale of highways rather than humans, people choose to drive despite its costs because they lack reasonable alternatives. Communities would be far healthier if our received infrastructure did more to encourage walking, cycling, mass transit, an other forms of transportation.


## Walkability has major economic benefits

It makes financial sense for cities to invest in walkability.There is a [scarcity of walkable neighborhoods](http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/24/3/317.abstract) in the US housing market, and this unmet demand is reflected in the prices people are willing to pay for housing in those cities that embrace a pedestrian-friendly model.

People are more likely to travel by foot when destinations are accessible, and having a critical mass of pedestrians signals that a neighborhood is safe and interesting, which in turn draws more people into that area. This creates a positive feedback loop – with people and opportunities nearby, it becomes increasingly attractive for businesses and residents to move in. Walkability [correlates](https://www.redfin.com/blog/2009/08/new-study-shows-one-point-of-walk-score-worth-up-to-3000.html) with property values so closely that it has become standard practice in real estate to advertise a home's "walk score", because a high grade earns a premium.

In Portland, residents drive 20% less than other major metropolitan areas. The city has experienced economic benefits beyond just a rise in property values. "Being green means Portlanders save a bundle on cars and gas, and local residents have more money to spend on other things they value, which in turn stimulates the local economy," said economist Joe Cortright in [*Portland’s Green Dividend*](http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2009/09/pdxgreendividend.pdf). Less driving leads to greater savings, and those savings are almost always spent more locally than they would be buying gas. 

## Walkability makes cities more affordable

Affordable housing would be far more attainable if we were to reduce the parking minimums that sustain and induce driving. A standard parking spot occupies as much square footage as a small studio apartment, and that's without factoring in the driveway space required for maneuvering into the spot. All in all, shops in California are required to provide 288 square feet of parking space for every 250 square feet of retail space – 115% more space is required to accommodate the parking for any new retail development. In Los Angeles, [3.3 spaces exist for every car in the city](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/12/parking-los-angeles-maps-study/418593/). Other states have similar or worse requirements. As a result, acreage devoted to parking hovers around [40% of the ground area in the core of the average sun belt city](http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Environment/E_Casestudy/E_casestudy2.htm). This is area that could otherwise be used for some other productive use. If we could make even a tiny dent in the amount of space consumed by parking, we could greatly improve the affordability of cities.

![](http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/5edb141/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F63%2F4d%2Fece226274d32bea4cc9007660e22%2F160113-rowsofcars-stock.jpg)

These parking minimums not only consume valuable space – they also induce more driving. With so much area devoted parking, the distance between destinations increases, which in turn increases the necessity of driving. With more drivers doing more traveling, more parking spots are needed to accommodate their cars. On the bright side, this also means that the benefits of changing these requirements are compounding. If we loosen requirements, we would also see a reduction in demand for parking spots, because the demand for driving itself would decrease as destinations are clustered closer together.

**Fun fact:** SimCity was forced to imagine that all parking lots were underground, because the game would be “really boring if it was proportional in terms of parking lots”. SimCity's lead designer [explained](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/the-philosophy-of-simcity-an-interview-with-the-games-lead-designer/275724/), “I was blown away by how much more space was parking lot rather than actual store. That was kind of a problem, because we were originally just going to model real cities ... We had to do the best we could do and still make the game look attractive.”

## The classic mantra of “Drive until you qualify” doesn’t hold up

When housing and transportation costs are considered together, cities regarded as costly are often more affordable than sprawling cities that are seen as more economical. It is true that the farther you move from the city center, the cheaper the cost of living, but the added costs of owning and operating a car quickly burns through whatever savings came from the move.

This calculation is even more clear when you also consider the opportunity cost of driving. Time spent in traffic means you have less time to do other things that you care about.

“There’s a simple rule of thumb: Every 10 minutes of commuting results in 10 percent fewer social connections,” [said](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_paumgarten) Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam. “Commuting is connected to social isolation, which causes unhappiness.”

Workers with long commutes are also less productive. Employee absenteeism would be about [15-20% ](http://www.academia.edu/277760/Are_workers_with_a_long_commute_less_productive_An_empirical_analysis_of_absenteeism)less if all workers had a negligible commute, and workers with a long commute are more likely to leave early or arrive late.

## Tactical, concentrated improvements have an outsized impact

It is feasible - both financially and politically - to make cities more walkable. Simple, low-cost improvements to features like [painted bike lanes](http://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/04/20/which-matters-more-a-bike-networks-connectivity-or-its-density/), [wayfinding signs](http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conferences/2015/ActiveTransportation/Presentations/Janet%20Fulton.pdf), [curb cuts](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&ved=0ahUKEwjo2cnFj7rOAhXI7xQKHeZhDtgQFghUMAo&url=http%3A%2F%2Famericanhistory.si.edu%2Fblog%2Fsmashing-barriers-access-disability-activism-and-curb-cuts&usg=AFQjCNHKLn48DZJb37DQR_F8yjDJT9bGdQ&sig2=uriDBv2RDJNjBOTcmsBdUA&cad=rja), and [tree coverage](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/enviroatlas-des-moines-ia-estimated-percent-tree-cover-along-walkable-roads) have an disproportionate impact in transforming a car-dependent metropolis into human-scale, walkable neighborhoods. It is rare that cities find a goal that is both worthwhile and attainable, so urban planners should jump on this opportunity.

Concentrated efforts to revitalize a small area can have a massive impact on an entire city. Mountain View, where I grew up, is a great example of this. When I was a kid, the town's suburban sprawl required a car ride to get anywhere. However, in the past few years, resources have been directed towards making specific areas in and around downtown more walkable, and residents all over town have seen the benefits. In the summer, the main street is closed for weekly street festivals. Downtown parking spots have been replaced with cafe seating, separated from the road by planter beds. The Stevens Creek Trail connects otherwise isolated neighborhoods to these walkable zones, providing a corridor extending from the marshlands at the edge of the city into the heart of Mountain View and through three other neighboring cities. This corridor lets residents all over town benefit from efforts concentrated in a few small areas of the city. Most streets are still oriented towards cars, but few neighborhoods are more than a short stroll away from a connection to pedestrian-friendly zone. When used strategically, limited resources can revitalize the walkability of an entire community.

Communities all around the country have begun to to experiment with [retrofitting their built environments](http://www.tacticalurbanismguide.com/about-the-project/) in other small ways. The changes don't have to be radical - they can be as small as repainting crosswalks or planting more trees to provide shade from the sun. California [requires](http://www.arb.ca.gov/planning/tsaq/cashout/cashout.htm) employers who provide parking for employees to offer a cash allowance in lieu of a parking space. [It has become common](https://www.ams.usda.gov/press-release/national-farmers-market-manager-survey-shows-farmers-markets-continue-grow) for downtowns to close Main Street for farmers markets and street fairs, and food trucks are a popular way to attract people to public spaces without the risk and hassle of setting up permanent shops. Improvements can range from grassroots efforts to add seating in public parks to city projects to reshape road networks and everything in between. Each community is different in its needs, resources, and existing infrastructure, so I find it particularly exciting to see how different towns come up with creative solutions that fit their particular situations.

Walkability leads to better health outcomes, more affordable housing, and greater economic vitality. The best part is that easy, low-cost changes can go a long way in improving the options for how people move around their communities. Cities all around the country have begun to appreciate and capitalize on alternative modes of transportation, especially walking. We still have decades of auto-dependent land use trends to offset, but small shifts in the way our received infrastructure is designed can go a long way to making our neighborhoods more walkable – and in turn healthier, more affordable, and more vibrant.
