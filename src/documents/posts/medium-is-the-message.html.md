The history of communication has been a pendulum, swinging between consolidated communalism and fragmented individualization and back again. The introduction of new media technologies is the core of these trends. In changing the way we relate to knowledge and to each other, they [fundamentally alter sense ratios and patterns of perception beyond the object-level content of ideas](http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/McLuhan's%20Insight%20Into%20The%20Media.htm).

Humans have historically been quite unaware of technology's influence upon them. However, our awareness and resistance to its meta-level effects have steadily increased as the variety of communication technologies has grown exponentially. The medium of our communication is inseparable from its content, and each swing of the pendulum has increased our appreciation of the fact.

Sound was the dominant medium for the vast majority of human history. As a result, information disseminated through oral histories within families, tribes, and villages. Knowledge was developed and jointly held amongst groups of individuals with shared experiences. The pendulum began to change direction away from this communalism with the advent of the written word, which enabled ideas to travel through time and space, independent from their original creators. However, during the transitionary period between the first recorded words and Gutenberg's invention of the printing press, books were extremely costly and written in scholarly languages accessible only to the clergy. As a result, the Church was the sole source of truth and held a monopoly on knowledge and culture in Europe. This power dynamic was more important than the content of any of the handmade books in its exclusive library, yet it was barely appreciated at the time because there was no alternative.

Then, the pendulum swung away from this centralized model. The printing press enabled production on a massive scale, resulting in the ownership and interpretation of ideas by private individuals. Thought was drawn inwards, leading to the invidualization of people, fragmentation of groups, and decentralization of cultural cachet. This formed the cornerstone of a sudden, massive shift in Western culture –– the Protestant Reformation. Its core tenant was a rejection of Catholic doctrine in favor of independent interpretation of the Bible, and that would not have been possible if the holy book had not been widely available. <img src='http://static.diffen.com/uploadz/9/91/Protestant-Branches.png' style='float: right; margin: 15px'/> The Reformation marked not a single schism between the Roman Catholic Church and a bloc of reformers; rather, it was the beginning of a fragmentation into a myriad of competing offshoots that continues to this day. The Vatican's monopoly on culture was over.

The Church was not completely oblivious to print's potential to undermine this monopoly. All books had to be approved by Church authorities before publication, and it was forbidden to print the Bible in any language except Latin. However, this early understanding that [the medium was at least as important as the message](http://www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/medium-message-50-years-later-91552) did not translate into a successful resistance against the changing nature of communication. It had been easy enough to censor the creation of a small number of handmade manuscripts, but it was logistically impossible to control the thousands of books and pamphlets churning off the presses. The pendulum continued swinging, despite the Church's attempt at resisting its unrelenting momentum.

It began to reverse direction once again during Industrial Revolution, and re-consolidation accelerated with the advent of electronic media. Patterns of thought were unified across formerly disjointed nations and peoples. Time was synchronized with railroad schedules, financial markets were coordinated with telegraph lines, and the most powerful ideas of the era were characterized by their ability to create a shared experience amongst individuals previously separated by geography. Mid-century American television is a prototypical instance of this cultural unity. There were only a handful of networks to cater to the entire country, and whole families watched the same shows together, so the programs offered were indistinguishable. Not only did people all get the same thing, but they also got it at the same time. The entire country learned of Kennedy's assassination simultaneously, and the televised moon landing reached school children and office workers all at once. It was a new era of shared consciousness.

Now, we are transitioning once again. An explosion of new technologies allow us to stream and curate our own content, replacing the centralized programming that traditionally defined media empires. As I write this essay, I am listening to my "Discover Weekly" playlist on Spotify. While a traditional radio DJ is forced to play a conservative list of popular songs in order to appeal to a wide audience, Spotify can give me music specially curated to my tastes without regard to what all of their other listeners want to hear. A similar shift has occurred in all forms of media; talking head radio, newspapers, and television have steadily been replaced with podcasting, RSS feeds, and Netflix. Culture that had previously been compressed into a narrow band centered on the average of the population's preferences now finally has the room to expand, branch off into subcultures, and fill the nooks and crannies of individuals' interests. This shift did not happen by itself. Rather, new technological realities like the internet, mobile devices, and the falling cost of bandwidth enabled the creation of new products to be developed to fulfill a latent desire that had been unfulfilled by existing media.

Changes in the way we consume and receive information have gone further than just one-to-one replacements of old media with updated versions. We've seen more radical changes and an explosion in number of options, too. Video calls, the blog post, the ephemeral snap, the tweet, and the WeChat sticker are just a few of the media that have been made newly available in the past few decades. The sheer number and variety of options have necessitated us to become experts aware of the changes in sense perception.

One product of this newfound awareness is that young people have become their own personal brand managers in a way that their parents never had to. On a daily basis, we make decisions like whether Facebook or Twitter is a more effective place to share that article we read over breakfast or if it's appropriate to connect to that acquaintance through a direct message or to just stick with a stuffy email. These decisions are matched with a new demand for interpretation of the medium chosen by our counterparts in communication, as well. When your boss texts you details about the meeting for tomorrow rather than sending off an email, that subtly tells you that he's trying to be hip and accessible. These are mundane, even trivial examples, but that is exactly the point –– awareness of the implications of different media infused daily life to an extent far greater than anything before.

Each successive swing of the pendulum has been shorter than the previous one, reflecting the accelerating pace of technological progress. While the transition from oral histories to the written word took thousands of years, the shift from a world of centralized electronic media to the mobile internet age has happened within my lifetime. These shortening time spans enable us to see change happen on the scale of years rather than centuries. As a result, we are more able to perceive the impact that media have upon our messages. In turn, we can play a more active role in determining that impact.
