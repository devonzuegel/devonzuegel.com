I love the feeling of flow, when I settle into my work and make steady, ruthless progress without distraction. It usually happens when I have my noise-cancelling headphones on and when I'm at just the edge of my skills, when my work is challenging but manageable, and my mind is fully engaged but not overwhelmed.

However, settling into this state rarely comes naturally. It happens most frequently when I have a bit of time pressure, a due date on the horizon, close enough to get me off my butt but not so close as to cause stress. Unfortunately, these circumstances aren't always easy to replicate, particularly when working on personal projects where there is no directly external force pushing me along. Without a sense of urgency, it's extremely rare for me to get into flow that can't be interrupted by a facebook message, chocolate cravings, an incoming email, or remembering to get my laundry out of the dryer.

I've experimented with countless strategies to combat this flow problem. I built a tiny text editor called Zen Writer which disables the backspace and highlights the current line to force myself to just write and stop censoring myself for early drafts. I use the Self Control app to block distracting websites, and I write out my goals whenever I sit down to get a chunk of work done to ensure I'm making the most out of my time. I continually tweak and customize all of my workspaces to optimize them for my purposes (though that may be more of a distraction than a productivity boost). These have been met with limited success, because they're relatively small in scope and only apply to a small portion of my workflow.

In comparison, the pomodoro technique has improved every aspect of my work and has been the most effective and generalized strategy I've picked up so far. The idea is to alternate 25-minute spurts of work and brief 5-minute breaks. You promise yourself to be totally focused during the work periods and totally disengaged from your work during the short breaks. Some people are extremely strict with the length of these periods. When I am strict I find that I can just chug through my work, but it takes a lot of discipline to do this and I'll be the first to admit that I rarely adhere to it perfectly. Even though when I started using the technique I was really quite bad at it, there was immediate increase in my productivity, and as I've become better at working with this strategy over time my productivity has steadily increased with it.

- **Activation Energy:** Pomodoro works well for me is because it's so easy to mentally commit yourself to "just 25 minutes". It can be difficult to convince myself to settle down to work on a side project for an entire evening after a long day at work, even though it is something I really enjoy and want to do. My solution is to do just one pomodoro, and if I'm still very tired then I will let myself relax. But almost invariably that first pomodoro jump-starts me and gets me pumped up to work for hours. Activation energy is hard to come by, and pomodoro does just that.

Why I love pomodoros:
- I can track my progress. I'm very strict with my 25-minute stretches of work, so if I get distracted for more than a minute during one pomodoro, I cancel the entire thing and force myself to take a break. This motivates me to blast through those last few minutes of pomodoro, and when I look at my daily graph of # of pomodoros, I know that I can add up those 25-minute periods to get a real sense of how much hardcore work time I've put in.

- It reminds me to get up out of my chair or at least to look out the window to rest my eyes.

- It forces me to stop in the middle of my work. This sounds counterproductive, because sometimes I'll stop in the middle of a deep flow or in the middle of solving a really difficult problem. Initially, I was afraid that I would lose everything in my mental cache when I got up from my coffee break. But what I realized over time is that -- so long as I kept to the 5-minute break, or something similarly short -- it actually got me really excited to get back to my work, to hype me up about my work, itching to get back to my work and finish my break. On top of that, it lengthens out my "flow" for a bit longer.

    + The hardest thing about getting work done is getting started. The strictness of Pomodoro which seems like a bad thing actually allows you to get away from that. You're almost always picking up in the middle of where you left off, so you already have an idea of what you've got to do next.

    + I found that I would sometimes still have a bit of a problem remembering where I had to pick up, especially if I wasn't very strict about my short 5-minute breaks (e.g. a friend or coworker starts talking to me) or especially during my 15-minute breaks. To remedy this issue, I make sure to spend the first 10 seconds of my break scribbling down my thoughts from the last sprint so that it can be fresh in my mind for the next one. This sounds like an added chore, but it actually has the added benefit of forcing you to crystallize your thoughts. If you've ever heard of the term "rubber duckying", the embarrassing phenomenon of figuring out the solution as soon as you start explaining an annoying bug to a coworker, you know that it can be immensely helpful to get away from your text editor for a little while and explain things aloud. I've experienced similar benefits from simply writing out my problems,
        ... also helps me troubleshoot in advance, makes me notice problems I didn't even register

- My work quality has improved as well, easier to grasp complexity when you're fully focused

- When I began using the Pomodoro technique, I suddenly gained fine-grained control over when I settle into that flow, and my productivity shot up.

Tips:
- work with someone else to keep you honest
