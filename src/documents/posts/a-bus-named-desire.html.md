# A Public Bus Named Desire #

When I first stumbled across the streetcar vs bus rapid transit (BRT) debate, I was strongly biased towards streetcars. My opinion was largely shaped by the few weeks I spent in Berlin this past summer. While I was in Germany, I relied most heavily on Berlin's friendly yellow Metrotrams. I really only used the U-bahn and S-bahn when I had to make long, cross-city trips, where the travel time difference was more than 10 or 15 minutes. I used the bus system only once, despite the fact that it was just as extensive as the Metrotram lines.

At the time, I naturally gravitated towards the Metrotrams without consciously considering its main substitute. I can think of a few reasons why this might have happened:

- As a first-time visitor to the city with a limited grasp of the German language, I liked the sense of direction the fixed tracks offered. When trying to figure out how to get somewhere, it was nice to see the **rails trailing through the city, clearly marking the Metrotram's route**.
- Somehow the trams **felt more predictable and dependabe** than the buses. This is plainly wrong – bus routes as just as well-defined and stable, and all transit options in Berlin runs almost perfectly on time (yay for German precision, unlike the Catrain and BART...). My hypothesis is that this perception is another byproduct of the fixed tracks, because they foster **a sense of permanence that boosts the entire system's credibility**.
- I've always associated buses with the sketchiest, most obnoxious transit riders. My main exposure to buses has been riding SF's dingy, smelly cars crushed by mobs of drunk Giants fans and overly talkative tourists, and I'd guess that buses have a similar image problem among most middle-class Americans. My **stigmatized perception of buses** governed my transit decisions, despite the fact that Berlin's buses are actually very clean, and its riders are on the whole very polite.

Upon further reflection, I see that streetcars' advantages all have one trait in common: they are a product of perception. Meanwhile, buses' advantages are far easier to quantify, so it is easy for BRT advocates to dismiss streetcars' advantages as petty and unimportant. While I agree that BRT is the way forward, it is critical that planners incorporate the advantages of streetcars to BRT ...

It's true that none of the reasons I listed above account for tangible differences, and if I were completey rational I would have been basically impartial. However, people are not completely rational. If we want to encourage usage of public transit (as all people on both sides of this debate do), we have to keep this in mind.

It's hard to disagree

As [I've mentioned before](http://devonzuegel.com/posts/streetcars-vs-buses-primer), buses. 

Basically, we need to give BRT a makeover, PR campaign.

What can we do to leverage the benefits of streetcars' positive perception within BRT systems?
